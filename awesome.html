            <h2>TOADS ARE LIT</h2>
            <p>Toads are clearly more awesome than frogs because of their unique, rugged charm and resilience. With their warty, textured skin, toads have a tough exterior that makes them look like true survivors of the wild. Unlike frogs, who rely heavily on water (which is cringe), toads are more adaptable and can thrive in a variety of environments, woodlands, swamps, beehives, saucepans, and more.</p>
            
            <h2>TOADS ARE METAL</h2>
            <p>They are alpha at controlling insect populations, as they are voracious eaters of pests like mosquitoes and beetles. Their slow, deliberate movements give them an aura, and their ability to secrete toxins from their skin provides them with a natural defense against predators and is also metal as freak.</p>
            
            <h2>FROGS ARE CRINGE</h2>
            <p>Toads may not be as flashy as frogs, but at least they arenâ€™t beta. Their quiet strength, adaptability, and essential role in ecosystems make them pretty darn awesome in their own right.</p>
