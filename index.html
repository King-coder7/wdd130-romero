            <h1> Welcome to our ultimate guide on the fascinating world of amphibians! This is war. While toads and frogs may seem similar at first glance if you’re an idiot, they each have very different characteristics that set them apart. Whether you're a curious nature enthusiast or a student at BYUI just trying to pass a class or someone who just really needs to get a hobby, we’ll explore the key differences between toads and frogs, from their appearance and behavior to their habitats and lifestyles. Join us as we venture down into the most bloody battle in debate history. Other topics may grab people’s attention for a moment, but the frog vs. toad debate truly is the ruler of them all.
