            <h2>FROGS ARE WAY COOLER</h2>
            <p>Frogs are often considered cooler than toads because of their sleek, vibrant appearance and impressive jumping abilities. Toads are mad slow and lazy. Unlike toads, which tend to have bumpy, dry skin, frogs usually have smooth, moist skin that gives them more rizz, which can be helpful in nature.</p>
            
            <h2>FROGS HAVE MADE HOPS</h2>
            <p>Frogs can leap many times their body length, which is sick as freak. Their vibrant colors, like bright greens and yellows, are very boring and nasty-looking. Toads, on the other hand, are very boring and nasty-looking.</p>
            
            <h2>YOU'RE FREE TO CHOOSE</h2>
            <p>Now everyone has their own opinions about frogs vs. toads. Freedom of thought and expression is an important part of the human experience. However, you should probably stop being friends with people who think toads are cooler than frogs. Those people are probably toxic and should be arrested. Frogs are simply better.</p>
            
            <h2>FROGS KNOW THEIR RIGHTS</h2>
            <p>Frogs also tend to be more active and vocal, unlike toads, which are silent sheeple. Overall, frogs' dynamic nature and eye-catching characteristics give them a leg up in the cool factor department compared to their toad cousins.</p>
